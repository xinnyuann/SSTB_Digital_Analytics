### [Start Small Think Big](https://www.startsmallthinkbig.org) (a.k.a. SSTB)
is a nonprofit that helps small business owners from marginalized communities create thriving businesses. Regardless of their financial status, birthplace, race, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, or network, all people deserve the power to make decisions about their own lives. 

### "Get Start with Digital Analytics for Your Small Business" 
is a workshop that offers a brief introduction to Digital Analytics, explains several key concepts to further answer questions from our fellow SMB, with a gentle introduction to Google Analytics 4:
- Why it matters to small business? Some use-case study, etc.
- How it would help understand and predict trends related to our customers, products and people?
- What are some open-sourced analytical tools/options small business owners could leverage? <b> Google Analytics 4</b>

*Google Analytics 4 (formerly known as “App + Web”) is a new kind of property, with different reports than what you're used to seeing in Universal Analytics properties.  One advantage of a Google Analytics 4 property is that you can use it for a website, an app, or both a website and app together. Universal Analytics properties only support websites.*
